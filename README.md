# 16millionrythms
Web page that uses javascript to enumerate and play all 16 million 12/8 djembe rythms

This page creates a single 12/8 bar and, when given a number, uses that number to generate the three basic 
djembe tones (Bass, Tone, Slap) or silence in each of the 12 beats. The generated rythm can then be played.

Of course, the 16 million are a limited subset of the actual rythms that could be played in a 12/8 beat, since it doesn't take into account triplets or other "roulements", flam strokes or any of the myriads of micro-timing accents that a human player can use.
